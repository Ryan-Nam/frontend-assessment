# Frontend Assessment Project

## Introduction

Firstly, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this frontend assessment. Through adhering to the provided coding guidelines, I've gained valuable insights and skills. The application of BEM, camelCase, and the focus on reusability not only enhanced my coding proficiency but also highlighted the importance of these practices in improving work efficiency and readability in a team setting. Using a consistent style ensures that the code is independent and doesn't interfere with other segments, making it easier to use reusable classes for additional coding.

## Key Features

- **Coding Standards**: Followed strict coding guidelines for better readability and maintainability.
- **BEM Syntax**: Used for custom CSS classes, improving the scalability and reusability of styles.
- **camelCase Naming**: Adopted for JavaScript variables and functions for consistency with JavaScript conventions.
- **Bootstrap 4.4.1 Integration**: Utilized mainly for layout and spacing, following Bootstrap's best practices.

## Bonus Point Explanation

- **Why 'banana'?**: The expression `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` results in "banana" in JavaScript. It's a play on string concatenation and type coercion where the unary plus operator attempts to convert 'a' to a number, leading to `NaN`, and the rest is string concatenation followed by converting to lowercase.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js (version 3.3.10)
- Bootstrap (version 4.4.1)

## Setup and Execution

To run this project locally:

1. **Download the Code**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install required npm packages.
3. **Install Specific Bootstrap Version**: Execute `npm i bootstrap@4.4.1` to install Bootstrap version 4.4.1.
4. **Start the Application**: Use `npm run dev` in the terminal to run the application in your local environment.
